# leaflet_challenge
I’m sorry there are so many files. I am having trouble with Github. I also added module 14 to the 15 githuub so there are even more
Please use the following files that are the most up-to-date:
Final_html
Final_index.html
Final_logic.js
Mappage.html
Final_style.css 
I am submitting this again to make sure that I included the correct html link. I was not able to use the website url submission.

I received this from Cortney Totty: “In order for an assignment to count towards gradution, it requires any score above 0. Regarding the rubric and challenge grade you are correct. Your score is is based on the rubric.” I am sure I have completed enough to get the one point required to get credit for the assignment. 
I will complete the assignments later, on my own. I need to ensure that I have one point on each assignment to graduate. Based on the rubric I completed the following:
Requirements
These requirements apply only to "Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization" as "Part 2" is optional with no extra points earning.
Map (60 points)
•	TileLayer loads without error (20 points)
•	Connects to geojson API using D3 without error (20 points)
•	Markers with size corresponding to earthquake magnitude (10 points)
•	A legend showing the depth and their corresponding color (10 points)
Data Points (40 points)
•	Data points scale with magnitude level (10 points)
•	Data points colors change with depth level (10 points)
•	Each point has a tooltip with the Magnitude, the location and depth (10 points)
•	All data points load in the correct locations (10 points)

Thank you for your time. Kathy
