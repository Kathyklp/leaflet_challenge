# leaflet_challenge

I have teh parts of this one but I couldn't get them to all work together - its going to take more work

I’m sorry there are so many files. I am having trouble with Github.
Please use the following files that are the most up-to-date:
*Fianl_.html
Final_app.js
Final_mod_14_info.ipynb
Final_samples.json
 
I am submitting this again to make sure that I included the correct html link. I was not able to use the website url submission.
*Github link:   git@github.com:Kathyklp/belly-button-challenge.git

I received this from Cortney Totty: “In order for an assignment to count towards gradution, it requires any score above 0. Regarding the rubric and challenge grade you are correct. Your score is is based on the rubric.” I am sure I have completed enough to get the one point required to get credit for the assignment. 
I will complete the assignments later, on my own. I need to ensure that I have one point on each assignment to graduate. Based on the rubric I completed the following:
Requirements
Bar Chart (30 points)  Mostly
Chart initializes without error (10 points)
Chart updates when a new sample is selected (5 points)
Chart uses Top 10 sample values as values (5 points)
Chart uses otu_ids as the labels (5 points)
Chart uses otu_labels as the tooltip (5 points)

Thank you for your time. Kathy
